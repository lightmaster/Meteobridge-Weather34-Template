# important  
for those not using mysql and using weather underground for chart data unfortunately this is no longer supported and only mysql is supported .this has been on the cards for sometime and crosschecking some sites i have to hand using the wucharts option i see no chart data any longer or the service is intermittent .sorry for any inconvience but it is not a template issue. the issue lies with weather underground and it looks like they may have discontinued this facility .If it returns in some form it may be possible to use again but it will have to be a tried and tested feature of weather underground .as of today 19th May 2019 the option and related files were removed ..brian
